## Equifax Security Breach

My team and I conducted an analysis of the Equifax Data Breach of September 2017 based off of the case study publication from [Harvard Business Review](https://store.hbr.org/product/data-breach-at-equifax/118031?sku=118031-PDF-ENG). There was a discussion revolving around a timeline of the incident, what caused the attack to go on for months, and what can be done going forward from a cybersecurity standpoint. 

Here is the video:

### Analysis

The areas I focused on in this study revolved around preventative measures that were not taken by Equifax, and the legal consequences of failing to do so.
It was identified that there was no monitoring of legacy systems that had expired SSL certificates, in addition to having no oversight in patching vulnerabilities within the network. This operational gap aided in allowing threat actors to penetrate the network as there was no 2FA or other security protocol in place to vertify the users attempting to gain access. Once in, there was a level of complacency that permitted user login credentials to be stored in plain text files with no level of encryption. Now, how were threat actors able to gain access to the network and navgiate themselves to locate login credentials and ultimately scrape the sensitive data of 145 million people? An unsegmented network.

### Takeaways

I enjoyed analyzing this incident as I was able to resonate with the technical aspects and offer guidance to my colleagues while learning about other areas of cybersecurity consultation. Our recommendations and overall incident response were recognized by the New York Metropolitan Chapter of the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) as we went on to come in 2nd place for our presentation.

### Conclusion

My career consistently has me working with sensitive data, more specifically PHI, within a cloud-based architecture. Becoming familiar with the NIST framework allows for mitigating potential issues, but also gaining an understanding of how to respond to risks that went undetected and getting back on track. It was interesting to se how the framework can apply to project management and not solely cybersecurity.
